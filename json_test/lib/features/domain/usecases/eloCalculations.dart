      adding extra elo gain and/or loss on wins/losses by KO/TKO,SUB,U-DEC,M-DEC, and S-DEC.  thoughts:

      frontend: you can toggle a button for any of these categories. upon toggle, a field pops up where you can enter in a number for the modifier (ex: 5, signifying 5 extra elo points on the category). 
      will probably need to cast param input to an int (or whatever the needed data type is) to idiot-proof)

      backend: we'll use submissions as an example.
      
      (fixed number, non percentage example)
      add int SUB_modifier_param as a param
      int SUB_modifier = SUB_modifier_param != null ? SUB_modifier_param : 0

      (percentage example)
      have the input be captured so that if a user enter '10' for 10 percent, SUB_modifier_param is set to 1.1

      add double SUB_modifier_param as a param
      double SUB_modifier = SUB_modifier_param != null ? SUB_modifier_param : 1.0
